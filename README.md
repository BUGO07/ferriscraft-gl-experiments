# OpenGL experiments for FerrisCraft
## Originally meant as a rewrite of my minecraft clone, but now I'm thinking about making into a new unique voxel game

## Star this or you will go bald.

## Features
- 3D Perspective Camera
- Diffuse and Specular Lighting
- Ambient Occlusion
- Optimized Meshing
- Blazingly Fast Terrain Generation
- Block Placing/Breaking
- Small UI Abstractions
- Not Much Else

## TODO
- Actual UI
- MultiPlayer

## Building and running
### Requirements
- [`rust`](https://rustup.rs/)

1. Clone the repo:\
    `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/BUGO07/ferriscraft-gl-experiments`
2. `cd ferriscraft-gl-experiments`
3. `cargo run` - builds and runs the project.
4. (Optional) `cargo run --release` for maximum performance. (longer compile times)
